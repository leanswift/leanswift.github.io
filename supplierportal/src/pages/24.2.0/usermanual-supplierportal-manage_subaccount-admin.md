Supplier Admin can group permissions under different categories and label them as required.

Supplier and list of subaccount users can be viewed in All Customers Grid page in the backend with subaccount columns. If it is 'YES' then it is subaccount user if it 'NO' then it is not a subaccount user. 

For supplier Admin the “Manage Sub Account” option is enabled and for sub account user the option will be disabled. Here it will display the “customer id” and its “parent id”.

There is another tab called &#39;Manage Sub accounts&#39; and is available only for Admin and not Sub-account. Here it will display the &#39;customer id&#39; and its &#39;parent id&#39;

The &#39;customer id&#39; is the subaccount id and &#39;parent id&#39; is the supplier id.
