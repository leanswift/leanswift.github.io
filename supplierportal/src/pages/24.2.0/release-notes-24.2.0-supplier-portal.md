# Enhancements

- The Connection Point, Data Flow, Work Flow can be imported from the Supplier Portal admin.
- Theme Configurations are enabled in PWA for better user experience.

# Prerequisites

IDM add-on should be configured for My Purchase orders data to be displayed in supplier portal.

# Limitations

- If multiple (more than 5) conditions are added or removed in a non-sequential manner, Filters may not fetch appropriate results. 
- Upload/Download Documents work only when IDM is Enabled 
- Order type ADN (Automatic Delivery note Generation) flag value saved in Magento only once during registration (assuming Order type configurations will not be changed in m3).  
- Default out of the box configuration that comes with installation cannot be deleted. 
- The buyer should unassign the task, after adding notes to supplier onboarding task. 
- Magento Admin user cannot send the invite to Supplier for onboarding. 
- IDM document notification from Infor is not triggered due to Wipro environment issue. But this works fine in LeanSwift environment.

# Known Issues

- When SHAC is kept as 2, and Automatic delivery note generation is enabled, advise and notify is done for a delivery note number PPS360 / TransNotifyHead is called. when the SHAC is disabled for the same supplier, and I advise a line with same delivery note number (line is not added in PPS360) but since the delivery note number is available in PPS360 during notify the PPS360 / TransNotifyHead is called and the PPS001MI/NotifyDelNot is not called. This causes the line to remain in processing state.
- When one line of PO is advised with a delivery note number (where Automatic delivery note generation is enabled) and Advise all / Advise multiple po's is tried for same PO with delivery note number, error message 'Shipment advice is not allowed - the order is already advised with delivery note' is displayed.

# Recommendation

- It is recommended to use eConnect and Supplier portal in separate instances.
