Supplier Admin can group permissions under different categories and label them as required.

Supplier and list of users can be viewed under the Customer Grid page in the backend.

Supplier Admin will have the &#39;Sub Account&#39; option&#39; enabled and Sub accounts will have that option disabled.

There is another tab called &#39;Manage Sub accounts&#39; and is available only for Admin and not Sub-account. Here it will display the &#39;customer id&#39; and its &#39;parent id&#39;

The &#39;customer id&#39; is the subaccount id and &#39;parent id&#39; is the supplier id.
