# Version 3.0.0 - CenPOS Addon for eConnect SX.e/CSD

## User Manual


- CenPOS Addon is supported for both Community and Enterprise version of Magento.

- Payment using CenPOS is developed as a separate Add-on to the eConnect extension.

- CenPOS’s Magento Extension SimpleWebpay is a prerequisite for this Add-on and we use the following GitHub link to download this extension.

  - https://github.com/mastercelta/SimpleWebpay/blob/master/composer.json

- PCI compliant CenPos functionality is ONLY available with the SFOEOrderTotLoadV4 API which is available only in SX.e versions 6.1.091 or higher

- So the version number of SX.e that eConnect is integrated with, has to be configured in the admin panel when this add-on is activated. If version is 6.1.091 or higher and SimpleWebPay module configuration is also available, then CC payment mode will be activated at “checkout” and order in SX.e will be created via SFOEOrderTotLoadV4 API. Otherwise order in SX.e will be created via OEFullOrderMntV6 API.

## SimpleWebpay Configuration

  - Go to Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > Other Payment Methods and look for Simple Webpay.
