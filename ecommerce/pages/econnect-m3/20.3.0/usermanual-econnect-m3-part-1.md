**Use M3 order history**

This parameter refers to the retrieval of order history from M3 from Magento front-end.

Select &quot;Yes&quot; to retrieve the order history from the ERP system in real-time when the user selects _Order History_ in _My Account_. This will make order history seamless between Magento and the ERP and any order changes in the back-end ERP will be displayed in Magento instantly.

Select &quot;No&quot; to only use the order history from Magento when the user selects Order History in My Account.

**Display Invoice**

Set this option to &#39;Yes&#39; in order to retrieve Invoice history details from M3. Please note that this does not apply to the B2C configuration when a single customer# in M3 is used for all orders.

In this case, the invoice history from Magento is always displayed by default.

## Shipping Method

This section manages the mapping between the Shipping methods that have been enabled within Magento (_Leanswift &gt; eConnect-ION Configuration &gt; Sales &gt; Shipping Methods) and the Delivery method and term within M3.

<kbd><img alt="shipping method" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/shipping-method.png"></kbd>

To add an additional mapping entry, simply press the &#39;Add&#39; button, and select the Magento Shipping Method value to map

<kbd><img alt="save config" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/save-config.png"></kbd>

[Go to Top](#table-of-contents)



## Manual Sync Configuration

Maximum number of records that can be selected at a time for manual sync can be configured here. There are separate configurations to set limit for Product, Customer and Order modules.

<kbd><img alt="manual sync config" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/manual-sync-configuration.png"></kbd>

There is a maximum limit of 200 beyond which manual sync cannot be done.

[Go to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Customer General Configuration

<kbd><img alt="general config" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/create-customer-on-placing-order-ims.png"></kbd>


This section now contains the key parameters for how to handle customer creation, both for a B2B and a B2C site.

**NOTE! The &#39;Customer Template ID&#39; field has dual function depending on whether the Customer Registration feature is used or not. For a single site, these features are mutually exclusive in that one is intended for B2B- and the other for B2C use.
If ### Create Customer via IMS
is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, Customer creation is done via IMS, else the regular econnect-ION workflow is followed. **

### Create Customer On Registration

This feature is intended for a B2B setup where new customers are allowed to register themselves on the front-end.

 <kbd><img alt="customer general config" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/create-customer-on-reg-ims.png"></kbd>

If **Create Customer On Registration** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, and if **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, the customer template **IONCUST** will be used to create a new customer number within M3 for each order being placed.

If **Create Customer On Registration** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, and if **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;No&#39;, the customer template mentioned under **Customer Template Id** will be used to create a new customer number within M3 for each order being placed.

eConnect will remove the **Create Customer On Placing Order** parameter as this indicates the site being configured is a B2B site where every customer always exists already when an order is place.

When **Create Customer On Registration** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, this indicates that as new customers register from the Magento front-end, a customer record is added in Magento – and a customer in a preliminary status (status 10) is created within M3.

A manual process is assumed within M3, where a Customer service/Accounting responsible would review these preliminary customers (credit checks etc.)  and if they are approved as a new customer the status in M3 is manually changed to active (20). While the customer status in M3 is preliminary (10), the customer in question can&#39;t place an order within Magento (eConnect performs a real-time check against M3 during the checkout process to validate the customer status). Products can be added to cart and the cart saved, but the checkout process can&#39;t be completed.

Setting **Create Customer On Registration** to &#39;No&#39; disables the registration feature completely, which then in turn enables the Create Customer On Placing Order:

<kbd><img alt="customer general config1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/create-customer-on-placing-order-ims.png"></kbd>

### Create Customer On Placing Order

This parameter is intended to be used for B2C sites where a choice needs to be made whether individual customers should exist in M3 for each consumer, or if a single &quot;common&quot; customer should be used for all consumer orders received from Magento.

If **Create Customer On Placing Order** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, and if **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, the customer template **IONCUST** will be used to create a new customer number within M3 for each order being placed. 

**NOTE: In this case the first order has to be synced twice. During the first sync ERP number is generated, and for the next sync order will be sent to m3**

If **Create Customer On Placing Order** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, and if **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;No&#39;, the customer template mentioned under **Customer Template Id** will be used to create a new customer number within M3 for each order being placed.

If a registered user is signed in, and as such already has a Magento customer# - a verification is always first performed to see whether there&#39;s a value on External Customer # or not. If not new customer# will be created in M3.

If **Create Customer On Placing Order** is set to &#39;No&#39;, then the same Customer template mentioned under **Common Customer Id** is used for each order created within M3. 

<kbd><img alt="customer general config2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/common-customer-ims.png"></kbd>

### Create Customer via IMS

If **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, IMS is used to send customer information via BODs to ION
If **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;No&#39;, the regular ION workflow is enabled.
When **Create Customer via IMS** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, the prefix mentioned in the field **ERP Customer Number Prefix** is used when creating new customer in ERP system via IMS

### User-defined Fields

**User-defined Fields** is used when Field Name and Value  is to be added to UserArea section in CustomerPartyMaster BOD before sending to ION

[Go to Top](#table-of-contents)


## Product Addition/ Synchronization

There exists functionality to conveniently map your M3 items to your Magento webshop. _Leanswift &gt; econnect-ION &gt; Configuration &gt; Product Addition/Synchronization In the current version, simple and configurable products are supported using this process, for all other product types, the default Magento process of importing via CSV is in place.

You can control the Product sync in website level by choosing Yes/No option in the Enable field. Each of the features, addition of new items, and syncing of existing can be controlled independently of each other.

Set Enable to Yes to enable this feature.

Apart from this, Addition and Sync can be turned on/off individually.

The Dropdown attributes that need to be synced can be added in the Dropdown attributes field. Multiple values can be selected.

Batch size and Sync from Date features are removed in this version as sync happens instantly unlike in the eLink version which requires a cron to be triggered.

The New product status should be set to No to ensure the products do not appear in the webshop and set to Yes to appear.

&#39;Style SKUs as Configurable Products&#39; can be set to Yes if we want style items and can be set to No to save them as simple items

### New in this version

<kbd><img alt="product addition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/master/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/product-addition-sync2.png"></kbd>

#### Item price

Admin can now choose to sync price between MMSAPR and ODSAPR. 

If **MMSAPR** is chosen, Price available for a product in MMS001 will get updated in product detail page of magento.
When ever price is added/updated in MMS001 in M3, Item master BOD gets generated. When an item master bod gets generated, MMS200MI/GetItmPrice gets triggered ( which can be seen in ION.log) and the same gets updated.


If **ODSAPR** is chosen, Price available for a product in MMS017 will get updated in product detail page of magento.
When ever price is added/updated in OIS017 ( For the Price list and currency mapped in Basic Data configuration, provided there is no customer mapped ) in M3, LSPriceList BOD gets generated during which MMS200MI/GetBasePrice API gets triggered and the price gets updated.


_Note: If multi-website is enabled, Price can be set to work on website level or global. If **Item price** is set to different configurations in different website then Price has to be set to website scope. Otherwise Price from the configuration on the last website will be overriden to all websites._


### Product attribute mapping

In order to ensure that the solution can deal with the flexibility and complexity of M3, the configuration allows you to specify what values from M3 should be mapped to the attributes which you have defined in magento. A Default field is provided to map a default value to any of the M3 fields.

<kbd><img alt="attribute mapping m3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/m3-attribute-mapping.png"></kbd>

**Product Addition conditions:**

As the most common scenario faced is that your M3 instance will contain far more items than you wish to have available in your webshop, eConnect comes with the ability to provide configurable criteria for selecting which items to include from M3.

<kbd><img alt="item addition condition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/item-addition-condition.png"></kbd>

In Addition to this, we also have the option to choose if it is &#39;Any/All&#39; of all conditions.

<kbd><img alt="condition true" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/condition-true.png"></kbd>

The main product tables are MITMAS, MITBAL and MITFAC.

### Product Synchronization - Item Disabling

Configuration is provided to Disable the products in Magento.

Set yes to Disable the product status and map the required conditions.

### Product Synchronization - AttributeSet Mapping

Magento uses the concept of attributes sets which allows products with similar features to be grouped and share a common set of attributes. Shoes for example would maybe need different attributes than the rental heavy equipment item. In order to ensure that items are imported and synced to Magento using the correct set of attributes, configuration is provided to assist in defining what M3 values indicate the product attribute set which the item will belong to.

<kbd><img alt="attribute mapping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/attributeset-mapping.png"></kbd>

Similar to category mapping, a feature has been provided to define the behavior for attribute sets which have changed or those which do have a matching M3 value as has been defined.

To enable this feature &#39;Change AttributeSet for existing products&#39;is set to Yes

### Product Synchronization - Category Mapping

When items are imported into Magento, they will need to have at least one product category to which they will be associated with. When this information is available in M3, this can be used to avoid duplication of record maintained.

<kbd><img alt="category mapping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/category-mapping.png"></kbd>

The category mapping is flexible enough to allow for more than one field in M3 to define which category it should belong to in Magento. The first step is to define the order and which fields in M3 will indicate category. The M3 Category source value should be entered in one continuous string.

Once the source is entered, Items get created into magento and the categories are created based on Source.

The first source value acts as a Parent and the rest of the source value forms sub-categories.

Once Category source is defined, any changes can cause abnormality in the behavior of product Addition/sync.In addition, a default category can be used for values which are missing values in the fields which have been defined for category mapping.

**Synchronization**

- Sync only applies to existing customers
- Customer master and Financial Data is synchronized.
- Address data is synchronized

<kbd><img alt="customer addition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/customer-addition.png"></kbd>



**Enable**

This setting provides the option to enable/disable the Customer Addition/Sync on website level.


**Enable Customer sync**

This setting provides the option to enable/disable the Customer Sync on website level.


**Enable Customer Addition**

This setting provides the option to enable/disable the Customer Addition on website level.


**Customer Group Id**

This setting provides the option to choose the group from which customers from M3 needs to be imported.

**New Account Email Notification**

This field sends a mail confirmation to the newly added customer when set to yes. The mail will have a &#39;Confirm Account&#39; option. When clicked on that, user will get redirected to frontend page

**Customer Master Mapping**

This section allows for mapping of additional Customer related fields within Magento to Customer master fields in M3. The mapping works exactly the same way as for the previous two sections. Customer&#39;s Order type, Facility and Division can also be synchronized. When a customer has this data synchronized, this detail gets picked over the basic data while order is getting placed

**Customer Address Mapping**

This section controls how the Billing and Shipping Address for the customer in Magento is to be created based on the address details in M3.

The mapping is done in the same way as for Shipping methods and Product Sync for example. The Magento address attribute to map is selected from the drop-down list in the &#39;Magento Attribute&#39; column. The M3 attribute this should be mapped to is then selected from the drop- down list in the &#39;M3 Attribute&#39; column.

## Sales

The &#39;Sales&#39; section contains three key settings related to the sales order process from Magento to M3.

<kbd><img alt="sales" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/sales.png"></kbd>

**Enable order comments**

If set to &#39;Yes&#39;, this enables sending header-level comments [entered in the last step of the Checkout process] for the entire order to M3.

**Allow Item Price**

If set to &#39;Yes&#39;, this enables sending Price for the order to M3.

**Capture Payment Online**

This option set to &#39;Yes&#39; will during Invoice creation in Magento [as part of the synchronization when the invoice details from M3 are used to create the Magento invoice] also invoke the &#39;Capture&#39; transaction from Magento for credit card orders. If this option is set to &#39;No&#39;, it&#39;s assumed that capture of funds via whatever payment gateway is used within Magento is handled manually via a separate process.

## Order Charges

The **Order Charges** group contains the settings related to how various additional charges within Magento, such as Tax- &amp; Shipping (freight) should be handled by eConnect.

**Tax Transfer &amp; Tax Charge code:** If Tax Transferis set to &#39;No&#39;, then dynamically the Tax Chargefield is not displayed as it doesn&#39;t apply:

<kbd><img alt="order charges" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges.png"></kbd>

When **Tax Transfer** is set to &#39;Yes&#39;, the **Tax Charge** field is visible:

<kbd><img alt="taxcode" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges-taxcode.png"></kbd>

The drop-down for Tax Charge code provides dynamic values from M3 to enable an easy selection and reduce the risk for erroneous entry:

<kbd><img alt="taxcode dropdown" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges-taxcode-dropdown.png"></kbd>

**Shipping/Freight Fee Charge Type**

This setting provides the option to determine whether to in M3 handle the Shipping fee from Magento as a Non-stock item or an order header charge.

There exists an option to enable/disable, with which one can control whether to send the shipping charge to M3 or not,the parameter offers the user a simple selection between the two options:

<kbd><img alt="order charges shipping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges-shipping.png"></kbd>


Depending on the selection, the following setting is dynamically adjusted. When &#39;Non-stock item&#39; is selected as in the screen shot above, the user can select Shipping/Freight Fee Item Number in the field below. The selection is also here dynamic against M3 so that it provides the user with a simple drop-down of applicable items from M3.

If &#39;Charges&#39; is selected, the following field provides selection of &#39;Shipping/Freight Fee Charge Code&#39;, and also in this case the list of available Charge ID&#39;s is dynamically retrieved from M3:

<kbd><img alt="Order charges shipping dropdown" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges-shipping-dropdown.png"></kbd>


**Gift Wrap Transfer**

The **Gift Wrap** Transfer parameter controls whether or not to transfer Gift Wrapping related information from Magento. This information includes:

- Order level gift wrapping (Cost &amp; Description)
- Line level gift wrapping (Cost &amp; Description)
- Gift messages (Order &amp; Line level)
- Printed Gift message card cost

If **Gift Wrap Transfer** is set to &#39;No&#39; – no information related to Gift Wrapping will be transferred from Magento to M3.

If **Gift Wrap Transfer** is set to &#39;Yes&#39; – all of the above-mentioned information can be transferred (depending on what&#39;s been configured and is in use within Magento).

Setting the parameter to &#39;Yes&#39;, will also in this case dynamically open up a number of additional fields on the screen:

<kbd><img alt="gift wrap charges" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/order-charges-giftwrap.png"></kbd>

The **Gift Wrap Charge Type** parameter controls whether the Gift Wrapping related costs in Magento should be transferred over to M3 as Charges (Order- and/or Line) or Non-stock items.

As in the previous screen shot – if **Gift Wrap Charge Type** is set to &#39;Non-stock items&#39; – the user is presented with selecting a non-stock item to use for (i) Order level gift wrapping charges and

(ii) Line level gift wrapping charges. These two non-stock items don&#39;t have to be different – they can both use the same M3 non-stock item value.

If instead the **Gift Wrap Charge Type** parameter is set to &#39;Charges&#39; – the following two parameters are dynamically adjusted to **Gift Wrap Order Charge Code** &amp; **Gift Wrap Line Charge Code** , offering a selection of Order-level and Line-level charge codes in M3 to handle Order-level Gift wrapping costs and Line-level Gift Wrapping costs.

<kbd><img alt="giftwrap charges" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/oder-charges-giftwrap-charges.png"></kbd>

## Payments

The Payments group contains the configuration related to credit-card integration, payment terms &amp; methods mapping, invoice fees etc.

<kbd><img alt="payments" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/payments.png"></kbd>

**Re-authorization Amount (Credit Cards)**

Single-authorization is used by eConnect, i.e. the credit card authorization created by Magento is transferred over to M3 without the need to re-authorize. This parameter will be removed.

**Payment Provider**

The mapping within this setup provides the link between Magento Payment Method values and Payment Terms &amp; Payment Method values in M3. In the case of the mapping for the Credit Card Payment Method, the &#39;M3 Credit Card Provider&#39; value also provides direct input to the order creation process.

**Invoice Fee Charge Type**

Invoice fees that can be imposed by certain payment providers can via this setting be handled two different ways in M3 – either as a non-stock item or as a [order header] charge.

<kbd><img alt="invoice fee type" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanswift/leanswift.github.io/dev/ecommerce/images/econnect-user-manual-ion-part1/invoice-fee-type.png"></kbd>

The selection made on this parameter will control which of the two values &#39;Invoice Fee Charge Code&#39; or &#39;Invoice Fee Charge Item no&#39; in the mapping below that will be used

**Invoice Fees**

This section is used if any Payment provider imposes some kind of transaction fee that needs to be represented on the order in M3. One example of this is the Swedish payment provider _Klarna_, that imposes a fee of about 25 SEK on each purchase when their service is used.

The fee corresponding to the value entered in the &#39;Invoice Fee Amount&#39; column is added to the order either as a header charge or as a non-stock item depending on the previous settings.

In the example here, a fee of $2.00 would be added to each order as a non-stock item when the Credit Card payment option is used.
